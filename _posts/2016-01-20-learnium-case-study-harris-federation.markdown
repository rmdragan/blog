### Executive Summary
**The Harris Federation used Learnium for content distribution and online discussion from November 2014 to June 2015 to support AS Level students taking part in an extracurricular academic and cultural enhancement programme, called the Harris Experience.**

### About Harris Federation
The Harris Federation is a federation of 36 primary and secondary academies in and around London.  The federation is setup as a not-for-profit charity that has built a reputation for setting standards of excellence and fulfilling high expectations.  Every Harris Academy inspected by Ofsted has been judged to be 'Good' or 'Outstanding', with over 75% of inspected Secondary Academies being rated as ‘Outstanding’.

### Challenges
The Harris Federation runs an extracurricular academic and cultural enhancement programme called the Harris Experience.  The programme is aimed at secondary school students from across the federation in order to prepare them for Oxbridge and Russell Group universities.

The Harris Experience Team had the challenge of coordinating face-to-face activities as well as supporting geographically distributed students more regularly with information and relevant content.  There was also a desire to engage students in online discussion and make them ‘feel’ like they were part of the Harris Experience programme.  Email and public social media had been used irregularly until then, but didn’t meet the Team’s requirements.

### Solution
To support their face-to-face activities, the Harris Experience Team required an online platform for information distribution and subject specific discussion – a secure social platform, branded specifically for the Harris Experience Programme, which students could access from anywhere using their personal email addresses.  Learnium was chosen for its ease of use, appeal to students, branding functionality and available support services.

This initial implementation of Learnium was setup for AS Level students on the Harris Experience Programme, with the intention of expanding to other year groups depending on the outcomes.

Through Learnium’s bulk import tool, all User Accounts and Courses were automatically created.  Students were enrolled in Communities on Learnium setup around their A Level subjects and other topics of interest (e.g. Oxbridge & Russell Group).  This way, the Harris Experience Team was able to efficiently distribute subject specific content and event information to students.  Students received content relevant to them (via the platform and email notifications) and could ask targeted questions and share topical content they themselves discovered.

### Results
Throughout the year, the Harris Experience Team used Learnium to quickly broadcast relevant content and information to their students.  As a result, most of the communication happened one-way.  Students were engaged in consuming the content created by the Team, primarily through the email notifications they received.

Weekly contact was maintained between the Harris Experience and Learnium Teams in order to provide platform engagement reports.  Over 40,000 email notifications were sent during the year and over 1000 community page views were recorded by students in the first 3 weeks.

Overall, the pilot was deemed successful and Harris Federation will continue with Learnium. A new cohort of Year 9 students will use the platform during the 2015-2016 Academic Year and the focus will be on generating two-way engagement.

### Testimonial
*“As coordinator of the Harris Experience enhancement programme, I needed a way to communicate with students from our academies all over London.  Learnium allowed me to easily send subject specific content and relevant information to students on the programme. The students and I found the platform easy and engaging to use and the Learnium Team were always on hand to provide support when required.”* ---
