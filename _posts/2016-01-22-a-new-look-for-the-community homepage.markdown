If you head over to a community page today, you'll notice that things look a bit different.

We've redesigned the community page and today we're making it live for all users. Design is part of Learnium's key values and our new page fits in with our new design language across mobile and newer parts of the web platform. The new page is also more mobile friendly so you'll have a fast and consistent experience no matter what screen size you're using.

We hope you enjoy the new design and please feel free to send us comments using the feedback box in the bottom right.
